### WORKLOG WEEK 2: Infrastructure, Management Tools and Cost Optimization

**Time:** 18/08/2025  22/08/2025

### Week 2 Objectives:
1. Master concepts about AWS Global Infrastructure (AZ, Region, Edge Location).
2. Understand management tools and basic security mechanisms.
3. Apply cost optimization methods and budget management.
4. Begin supplementary research on AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF).

### Tasks to be deployed this week:
| Day | Task | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Materials |
| --- | ---- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Mon | Deep dive into AWS Global Infrastructure: Data Center (hardware optimization), Availability Zone (AZ, fault isolation), Region (minimum 3 AZs), and Edge Location (presence points, running CloudFront, WAF). | 18/08/2025 | 18/08/2025 | |
| Tue | Learn AWS Management Tools: AWS Management Console (Root user, IAM user), AWS CLI (command line), and AWS SDK (automate request processing and authentication). | 19/08/2025 | 19/08/2025 | |
| Wed | Deep research on Cost Optimization: Payment methods On-Demand (default), Long-term commitment (Reserve Instance/Saving Plan), and Temporary resources (Spot, low cost but can be reclaimed). | 20/08/2025 | 20/08/2025 | |
| Thu | Practice Lab: Set up AWS Budget to create and monitor cost usage thresholds or commitment usage thresholds. Learn how to use Cost Allocation Tagging to manage costs by department/application. | 21/08/2025 | 21/08/2025 | |
| Fri | Supplementary research: Learn overview of AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF) - self-assessment architecture framework. Read about AWS support plans (Basic, Developer, Business, Enterprise) and appropriate usage timing. | 22/08/2025 | 22/08/2025 | |

### Week 2 Achievements:
