  * Storage Gateway - connecting on-premises storage with AWS
  * EC2 Autoscaling to automatically adjust number of instances
  * Lightsail - simple VPS solution for beginners
* Build mathematical foundation for NLP and Machine Learning:
  * Vector Spaces and mathematical operations
  * Euclidean Distance & Cosine Similarity for measuring similarity
  * Probability and Bayes' Rule in text classification
  * Linear Algebra with Python Numpy
* Finalize semester project concept and setup documentation framework:
  * Choose suitable Hugo theme
  * Learn how to write Workshop report using Hugo
  * Agree on final idea with team
