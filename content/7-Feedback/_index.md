### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at AWS in the First Cloud Journey program is extremely professional and dynamic. The office is designed to international standards with full amenities, and the open workspace facilitates easy communication between team members. Notably, Amazon's "Day 1" culture is truly applied in daily work - always maintaining an entrepreneurial spirit and continuous innovation.

The standout feature is the support from team members: everyone is always ready to answer questions, share experiences, and create opportunities for interns to learn. The working atmosphere is comfortable yet maintains professionalism, helping me balance work pressure and personal development.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentors have a very effective coaching style following the "learn by doing" method. Instead of providing direct answers, mentors guide me on how to think, analyze problems, and find solutions myself. This helps me develop independent thinking and problem-solving skills sustainably. They listen and answer all questions in detail. Share best practices and real-world experiences from large projects. Provide constructive feedback to help me improve daily.

The admin team is also very attentive in supporting administrative procedures, answering questions about company policies, and creating the best conditions for the internship process.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The assigned work has a high degree of relevance (90%) to the knowledge learned at school.

In particular, I was exposed to real AWS technologies and services such as EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, CloudFormation - knowledge that was only theoretical at school. This helped me understand more deeply the practical application of what I learned, while expanding my vision of modern technology trends.

However, there is still about 10% of work that requires me to self-study and research more (like Terraform, Kubernetes), but this is actually a good opportunity to practice self-learning skills - an essential skill in the IT industry.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
The First Cloud Journey program provides comprehensive learning opportunities:

**Technical Skills:**
- Proficiency in AWS Cloud Services: EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, CloudFormation, CDK
- Understanding of CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy
- Applying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with CloudFormation and Terraform
- Container orchestration with Docker, ECS
- Monitoring and logging with CloudWatch

**Soft Skills:**
- Working in Agile/Scrum model with sprint planning, daily standup, retrospective
- Professional presentation and work reporting skills
- Effective communication in multicultural teams (English and Vietnamese)
- Time management and work prioritization

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The working culture at AWS is built on 16 Leadership Principles, of which I experienced most clearly:
- **Customer Obsession:** Always putting customers first in every decision
- **Ownership:** Each person takes responsibility for their work as an owner
- **Learn and Be Curious:** Continuously learning and exploring new technologies
- **Earn Trust:** Building trust through transparency and responsibility

The team spirit is excellent: people are willing to support each other regardless of position or time. When I encounter blocking issues, there is always someone ready for pair programming or participating in brainstorming to find solutions. The team regularly organizes:
- Weekly knowledge sharing sessions
- Code review sessions to learn from each other
- Lunch and learn sessions about new technologies

I feel like I am truly part of the team, not just an intern but a valuable contributor.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company provides flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to participate in internal training sessions is a big plus.

**Words of Thanks:**
I would like to sincerely thank the FCJ team, mentors, and everyone who supported me throughout the internship. This is an extremely valuable experience that I will never forget. I hope the feedback above will help the program become better for future interns.

I am very proud to be part of the First Cloud Journey program and hope to continue contributing to AWS in the future! 🚀
